# Real estate sales scraping for Belgium

##  1. Description

This project is about building a data set related to real estate sales in Belgium from scratch
by using web scraping tools in Python.

The data set should contain the common variables of interest when one is interested in real estate sales:
location, surface, price, number of rooms, amenities (equipped kitchen, terrace, garden...). It should cover all
the belgian territory, contain both apartments and houses, and count a minimum of 10 000 entries.

##  2. Our strategy
We choose to use the data from [immoweb.com](http://www.immoweb.com) which is one of the top website in the country.

##  3. Technically
The data scraping from the website uses Python's packages selenium and BeautifulSoup. The first one is required to navigate
through the results of the queries made by an end user. The second package allows to extract the required data.
